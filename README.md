# CM-SC1
This repository is for CM-SC: Cross-modal spatial-channel attention network for image captioning. You can send email: shamim2@mail.ustc.edu.cn for any type of difficulty.
 We have modified the original X-Linear attention by Cross-variance instead of bilinear pooling for both LSTM and Transformer for image captioning (https://github.com/JDAI-CV/image-captioning). Our paper can be found  (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938224003056).
